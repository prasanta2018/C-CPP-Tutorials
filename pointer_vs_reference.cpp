    cout << *pNum << endl;     // 100
    cout << num1 << endl;      // 100

    //Both give the memory address of num1 variable
    cout << &num1 << endl;     // 0x61fec8
    cout << pNum << endl;      // 0x61fec8

    // gives location of pointer

    // pointer can be reassigned to point to some other address

    // creating a reference(alias) to the num1
    int& refNum = num1;        // Implicit referencing (num1, not &num1)

    cout << &num1 << endl;      // 0x61fec8
    cout << &refNum << endl;    // 0x61fec8

    // This will change num1 and refNum both to the value of num2

    // Reference cannot be re-assigned
    // In other words "invalid conversion from 'int*' to 'int'"
